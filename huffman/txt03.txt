Guide

The MOTU team is pondering merging this page with UbuntuDevelopment, expect an announcement on ubuntu-motu@lists.ubuntu.com soon.
If you want to make changes to this page, ask in #ubuntu-motu or on the MOTU mailing list for a better place for those changes.

Despite me having studied many UbuntuDevelopment pages, I find this page might be valuable. As a prospective motu it is very good to have this information summarized in one place. I hope a page like this is being kept around. 28 Jul 2008, Mouz

Almost all of these cases are addressed in UbuntuDevelopment or other process documents already. If this document contains more information, we should merge it into the other places.

This is an old early draft of many of the other documents. I don't think there's really much to merge, but lets leave it around until the wiki cleanup is complete, as there's no coherent replacement, and it deserves a check to make sure everything was addressed - EmmetHikory


Note - this is a very early draft. Needs very much work. Please update it.

Bug Patches

Self-Assign the bug, and set the status to "In Progress". Create a debdiff that fixes the bug, including a note that the bug is closed in the changelog ("(LP: #bugnumber)"). Assign the bug to "Nobody", and set the status to "Confirmed". Subscribe ubuntu-sponsors. Subscribe to the bug, and when it is uploaded, check the build status. Once it has built correctly, set the status to "Fix Released". Do not update the Assignee. If the package fails to build, address any problems as soon as possible.

Reviewer / Sponsor
(otional) Self-Assign the bug, and set the status to "In Progress". Review the patch to make sure it makes sense. Download the package and the patch. Verify that the package builds properly. Verify that the package installs properly. Verify that the bug is addressed. Upload the package. Set the bug status to "Fix Committed", and include the .changes file as a comment. If alterations are required to the patch, add a comment indicating the alterations requested, and set the status to "Needs Info".

Sole MOTU

New Upstream Packages
Initial Requestor
Create a working package of the new upstream. Include all Ubuntu and Debian bugs addressed in the changelog. Upload to REVU. Open a new bug with a title "new upstream version x.y.z", with a link to REVU and the new changelog entry in the bug. Include any additional information that may be useful when making a decision to upload the bug. Add a comment attaching the output of diff -Nur on the two debian directories to the bug, with an explanation of any particular changes that may be confusing to reviewers. Subscribe ubuntu-sponsors. Do not assign the bug. Do not set the status. Once the package is uploaded, verify the package builds correctly, and set the status to "Fix Released". Once uploaded, do not use REVU for new revisions, instead open a bug and follow the bug fix procedure above.

Reviewer Sponsor
Review the REVU package as normal (some leniency may be in order to minimize changes from Debian). Verify that the debian/ differences are as small as are required to support the new upstream (unless additional changes are requested in light of policy updates, etc.). If accepted, comment in REVU. IF you are the second advocate in REVU, upload the package, Self-Assign the bug, and set the status to "Fix Committed". If alterations are required for the new package, comment in REVU.

Sole MOTU
Create a working package of the new upstream. Include all Ubuntu and Debian bugs addressed in the changelog. Upload to REVU (or alternate location).

Receive confirmation from another MOTU that the changes are sane. Upload the package. Set the status to "Fix Committed", and include the .changes file in a comment. When all builds are complete, set the status to "Fix Released".

If the package should not be SYNC's, set the status to "Rejected" with an explanation of the rejection.
